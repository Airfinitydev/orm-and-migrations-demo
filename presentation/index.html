            <h2>Source Control Your Database</h2>
          </section>
          <section>
            <p>If your database is the foundation of your application, and your application code is under source control, then surely your database should be too right?</p>
          </section>
          <section>
            <h3>Reasons for not having it under control</h3>            
            <p class="fragment">Legacy code base, old habits die hard</p>
            <p class="fragment">Lack of time, new feature > paying back tech debt</p>
            <p class="fragment">Lack of appetite for rewrite from management</p>
            <p class="fragment">Lack of experience in the development team</p>
          </section>
          <section>
            <h3>Excuses, Excuses</h3>
            <p>None of these should stop you, with a bit of will and minimal effort you can get your database schema under control, even if you take a DIY approach.</p>
          </section>
				</section>

				<section>
          <section>
            <h3>MVP Database Versioning</h3>
            <p class="fragment">Versioning your database, managing schema changes and using an ORM in your code all go hand in hand.</p>
            <p class="fragment">However, at the most basic level all you really need is to know what shape your database objects have now, 
              and the ability to record changes to this state over time.</p>
          </section>
          <section>
            <h3>This can take the form of the following</h3>
            <p class="fragment">A script or set of scripts defining every db object that exists right now.</p>
            <p class="fragment">A record of the current 'version' of the database, held in the database itself.</p>
            <p class="fragment">A set of planned changes, again as a script, that can be executed in your database.</p>
          </section>
          <section>
            <h3>Then what?</h3>
            <p class="fragment">When you apply the next set of changes, add a record to the database version table and re-generate your baseline script</p>
            <p class="fragment">Stick the baseline and changes in source control and you're good to go</p>
            <p class="fragment">Wash, rinse, repeat (everybody!)</p>
            <p class="fragment">Source controlled database schema changes FTW! Huzzah!</p>
          </section>

					<section>
            <h3>A Better Way</h3>
            <p class="fragment">The DIY approach can get you out of a sticky situation and help to introduce a more professional work ethic to your project</p>
            <p class="fragment">But there are many tools out there to make this much easier for you.</p>

	  				<h3>ORM</h3>
            <p class="fragment">An Object Relation Mapper (ORM) is a way of representing your database tables as objects in the language of your application.</p>
          </section>
          <section>
            <h3>Benefits include;</h3>
            <p class="fragment">Conceptually simpler, makes development easier</p>
            <p class="fragment">Saves manually creating boilerplate code</p>
            <p class="fragment">Prevents the need to use in-line SQL, (security yo)</p>
            <p class="fragment">Abstracts your data layer, increases portability/re-usability</p>
            <p class="fragment">Allows for testing of your data access layer</p>
            <p class="fragment">Facilitates code-first approach, migrations FTW!</p>
          </section>
        </section>

        <section>
          <section>
            <h3>ORMs Are Essential</h3>
            <p class="fragment">Because they facilitate data migrations, enabling source control of your database</p>
            <p class="fragment">Model objects are used to create SQL scripts that define your database structure</p>
            <p class="fragment">At Airfinity we use the SQLAlchemy ORM and a data migration library called Alembic</p>
            <p class="fragment">We can run a CLI command to create schema changes from code</p>
            <p class="fragment">We can automate this command, as part of our CI pipeline</p>
            <p class="fragment">No more worrying about manually migrating db changes</p>

          <h3>Non-Trivial Query</h3>
            <pre class="stretch">
              <code class="python" data-trim contenteditable style="font-size: 15px;">

                  ## SqlAlchemy ORM usage for non-trivial query

                  Lets say you wanted to do something like this; 

                  SELECT  c.name AS category_name, o.airfinity_score, 
                          o.name AS organiser_name, oc.category_id, oc.organiser_id
                  FROM 	  category c
                          JOIN organiser_category oc ON c.id = oc.category_id
                            JOIN organiser o ON oc.organiser_id = o.id
                  WHERE   c.name != 'Unknown'
                  ORDER BY c.name ASC, o.airfinity_score DESC, o.name ASC;
                  
                  There are several things going on in this query; 

                  - Selecting a subset of fields, rather than whole entities
                  
                  - Joining across more than one table
                  
                  - Filtering based on a specific field
                  
                  - Ordering by multiple fields, with differing sort orders
                  
                  Whilst SqlAlchemy is powerful its documentation can be 'challenging', below is a working example of the equivalent query using the ORM.
                  
                  ```
                  eg_organiser_categories = eg_session.query(
                          eg.Category.name.label('category_name'), 
                          eg.Organiser.airfinity_score, 
                          eg.Organiser.name.label('organiser_name'), 
                          eg.OrganiserCategory.category_id, 
                          eg.OrganiserCategory.organiser_id)
                  .select_from(eg.Category).join(eg.OrganiserCategory).join(eg.Organiser)
                  .filter(eg.Category.name != 'Unknown')
                  .order_by(eg.Category.name)
                  .order_by(desc(eg.Organiser.airfinity_score))
                  .order_by(eg.Organiser.name)
                  .all()
                  ```
                  
                  This does what it says on the tin, much like ronseal, but just in case you want a breakdown;

                  - Firstly we pass a comma separated list of entity.fields to the query() method, 
                    note the use of the .label() methods to rename output columns, 
                    these can then be referred to when working with the results as you might expect (eg; result.category_name)

                  - Then to force the JOINs to be applied in the order we want as per the SQL above 
                    (left to right; Category, OrganiserCategory then Organiser) 
                    we use the select_from() method to start then append .join() methods

                  - The .join() methods rely on there being the proper relationships defined on the models, 
                    specifically the foreign keys between these are used to determine the columns to JOIN on, 
                    if this is not the case for your desired JOIN, 
                    i.e you want to JOIN on different columns or you have multiple foreign keys in the direction of your JOINS 
                    (such as with self-relationships or multiple relationships from 1 entity to a 2nd) 
                    you will need to refer to this page for alternative JOIN syntax: 
                    (http://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/latest/orm/tutorial.html#querying-with-joins)

                  - Next comes the filter_by(), fairly self-explanatory

                  - Then the order_by() methods, note the use of desc() within the second order_by(), 
                    the order in which you apply these order_by() methods dictates the sorting, same as the raw SQL

                  - Finally .all() to execute and return all records
                  
                  Looking at that it seems obvious, but it took a bit of digging to figure out, enjoy!

            <h3>Never break the chain</h3>
            <p class="fragment">Alembic creates a linear history of database schema versions, each version points to it's predecessor so that the versions form a chain.</p>
            <p class="fragment">We can migrate our database schema up and down through the chain of versions at will, using the alembic CLI tool.</p>
            <p class="fragment">We can also view the current version of the schema and the head version (latest version) at any time so we can find our position in the chain.</p>
            <p class="fragment">The latest version is the 'head' of the chain.</p>

            <h3>Unforking</h3>
            <p class="fragment">Concurrent feature development from the same starting point will result in a fork in the chain</p>
            <p class="fragment">When the changes are merged there will be two heads and alembic will not know which to apply.</p>
            <p class="fragment">Up to you to manually resolve the issue, luckily this is trivial to fix.</p>
            <p class="fragment">Identify the version numbers and bring the diverging paths in line by making one the downstream migration of the other.</p>
            <p class="fragment">Voila your fork is removed and your history is linear again, long live the chain!</p>

            <h3>Brief word about Django</h3>
            <p class="fragment">Django's ORM numbers the migrations sequentially, which you may or may not like</p>
            <p class="fragment">You can easily spot the forked migrations from the directory listing, not so with Alembic</p>
            <p class="fragment">You have to rename files to adjust the chain of versions, rather than edit as with Alembic</p>
            <p class="fragment">Whether this is better or worse than Alembic's approach is personal preference</p>
